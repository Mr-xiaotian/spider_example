Study on Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis from Yin Fire Theory,https://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CAPJ&filename=SYZY20231101007,LI Haoming;ZHANG Lan,Journal of Practical Traditional Chinese Internal Medicine,2023-11-02 10:52,Journals,,Yin fire theory;; chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis;; the fire of qi deficiency;; liver depression and spleen deficiency;; spleen-kidney Yang deficiency;,Based on Li Dongyuan’s Yin fire theory， this paper discusses the relationship between chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and Yin fire，and holds that spleen deficiency is the foundation of the disease， liver depression and spleen deficiency and spleen kidney Yang deficiency are the different syndrome types of Yin fire evolution in Hashimoto’s disease during the abnormal A-function. Yin fire theory plays an important role in explaining the pathogenesis of Hashimoto’s disease and provides new ideas for clinical treatment.

Methods Seventy-seven patients were diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or complicated with other thyroid diseases by operation and histological examination at this department from November 2002 to March 2005. All their clinical records including general information, the results of careful physical examination, thyroid correlated hormone tests, color Doppler, fine needle aspiration cytological examination and some intraoperative examinations have been retrospectively analyzed in this report. Results There were 53 cases of simple chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, 10 cases complicated by papillary carcinoma, 1 case complicated by follicular carcinoma, 2 cases complicated by non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 6 cases complicated by nodular goiter, 4 cases complicated by follicular adenoma, and 1 complicated by parathyroid adenoma. Almost all the operations were successfull and the symptoms of the diseases were alleviated. Seventy-two patients had been followed up ranging from two months to two years differently and none of them relapsed. Sixty-three of these patients have received thyrine inhibition and vicariousness treatment, 2 patients who complicated by non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma had been hospitalized and 7 patients complicated by carcinoma were treated with iodine-131. Conclusion The clinical manifestations of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis are complex, and it often complicated with other thyroid disease, which make it difficult to diagnose the diseases before operation.

The median follow-up was （35.51±39.84） months for 37 patients in TC group, and 36 patients survived with a median period of （34.50±39.91） months; the median follow-up was （39.50±29.00） months for 12 patients in TL group, and 10 patients survived with a median period of （44.70±28.78） months. Conclusions CLT with thyroid malignancies are not uncommon in clinical practice. While thyroid carcinoma accounts for majority of these malignanc- ies, its clinicopathologic features, treatment, and prognosis differs with thyroid lymphoma. Surgery may be appropriate for CLT patients with rapid thyroid enlargement or nodule, and for patients with solitary solid nodule or nodules with calcification revealed by B ultrasound."

In the meantime, 109 normal children （control） were examined by ultrasound imaging. The results showed that thyroid imaging in healthy children was a smooth echo pattern with stronger homogenous echogram than surrounding muscle tissue. The patients with diffuse goiter showed an abnormally enlarged thyroid volume. Ultrasonic imaging showed a variedly patchy hypoechogenicity in 22 （84.6%） of 26 children with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, of whom 18 （81.8%） had positive results of antibody testing. Contrarily,   echo   patterns were normal in 17 （70.8%） of 24 patients with diffuse thyroid proliferation and only the remainders （7/24,29.1%） had abnormal echo patterns as well as elevated autoantibody titers, of whom 2 were confirmed as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis by repeated fine needle aspiration biopsy 1 year later. With combined ultrsound imaging and antibody determination, 92% of the cases of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis could be diagnosed. Thus, our study suggests that ultrasonic imaging be an easy, noninvasive, reproducible and a valuable procedure in the differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in children when combined with serological tests."

Therefore 300 cases of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis from 1964 to 1995 were reviewed. There were 37 males and 263 females, and 52 had a pathological diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Results Among 300 patients, 2 had coexistent thyroid papillary carcinoma. The original symptom in 64. 3% patients was hypothyroidism, and the total incidence of hypothyroidism was 76%. It was also indicated in this study that the occurrence of hypothyroidism in chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis patient was associated with the elevated level of antithyroglobulin antibody, enlargement and tenderness of thyroid gland. Conclusion In our study, as the low incidence of coexisted thyroid carcinoma, with the high incidence of hypothyroidism it seemed to be that the elevated antithyroglobulin antibody could be a more effective factor in the development of hypothyroidism in chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis."

Methods The clinicopathologic data of 756 cases of PTC were collected from January 2014 to January 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University were collected. The patients were designed to observational group（PTC with coexistent CLT, n=194） and control group（simple PTC, n=562） according to whether CLT was diagnosed by pathology, then the clinical data, ultrasonic features, thyroid function, and pathological features in these two groups were compared. Results The proportion of the female patients,the proportions of theserum thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid autoimmune antibodies（thyroglobulin antibody and thyroid peroxidase antibody）, and the proportion of multifocal carcinoma in the observational group were significantly higher than those in the control group（P＜0.05）. There were no significant differences in the preoperative ultrasound, tumor diameter, thyroid capsule invasion, central lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage in these two groups（P＞0.05）. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the female, serum thyroid autoimmune antibodies, and the multifocal carcinoma were the independent predictive factors of PTC with CLT（P＜0.05）. Conclusions There might be a certain correlation between PTC and CLT, PTC with coexistent CLT is more common in female patient and with multifocal carcinoma. With coexistent CLT does not increase invasion of PTC. This may be associated with limit of CLT to development of PTC nodules. It is speculated that CLT may be a protective factor of PTC."

The aim of this present study was to determine the relationship between CLT and the response of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma（DTC） who received surgery and radioactive iodine(131I) treatment for thyroid carcinoma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 128 patients who received initial treatment for thyroid disease at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2014 to 2016. Data of the participants with histologically confirmed DTC were analysed according to the presence（CLT1） or absence（CLT0） of concurrent CLT. One-way analysis, chi-square test and rank-sum test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the clinicopathological features. Correlation analysis was conducted between response to131I and the presence or absence of concurrent CLT. The response was evaluated between two groups according to 2015 American Thyroid Association（ATA） response system. Results: Of the 128 patients, smaller tumor size and a greater female preponderance were noted in the patients with CLT compared with those without CLT（P=0.028, P=0.011, respectively）. There was no significant difference inage, multifocality, stages of lymph nodes, capsular invasion and TNM classification system between the groups for DTC during 24-month mean follow-up period. There was no significant difference in response between two groups. The excellent response（ER） was 72.7%（40/55） and 68.5%（50/73）, respectively. Indeterminate response（IR） was 14.5%（8/55） and 13.7%（10/73）, respectively. Biochemical incomplete response（BIR） was 3.6%（2/55） and 6.8%（5/73）, respectively. Structural incomplete response（SIR） was 9.1%（5/55） and 10.9%（8/73）, respectively. Meanwhile, there was no correlation between response and the presence or absence of CTL（P=0.519）. Conclusion: Our results do not support the hypothesis that CLT is associated with the response to131I treatment for DTC patients."

Methods: A total of 226 children（aged from 7-14 years） from January 2016 to December 2019 at Children′s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University were enrolled, including 124 GD children（GD group）and 102 HD（HD group）. HD children were further divided into HT with hyperthyroidism（HT with hyperthyroidism group,38 cases） and HT with hypothyroidism（HT with hypothyroidism group, 64 cases）. Two hundred healthy children with matching age were served as controls. Free triiodothyronine（FT3）, free thyroxine（FT4）, thyroid stimulating hormone（TSH）,anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibody（anti-TPOAb）, anti-thyroglobulin antibody（anti-TGAb） and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody（TRAb） were detected with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay（ECLIA）. Indices of ultrasonography including transverse diameter and anteroposterior diameter of right and left lobes of thyroid, isthmic anteroposterior diameter were measured, and blood flow in thyroid was detected by color Doppler flow imaging（CDFI）. Both the thyroid function serological parameters and features of ultrasound examination were compared between the four groups.Results: Compared with HT with hyperthyroidism group, GD group had an increased TRAb level [（18.98±20.11） IU/mL vs.（0.33±0.41） IU/L] but lower levels of anti-TPOAb [（176.10±188.84） IU/mL vs.（219.65±203.66） IU/mL] and anti-TGAb[（242.40 ±632.15） IU/mL vs.（471.56 ±361.12） IU/mL]. A further analysis showed that the positive rate of TRAb in GD group was higher than that in HT with hyperthyroidism group, while HT with hyperthyroidism group had higher positive rates of anti-TPOAb（93% vs 52%） and anti-TGAb（84% vs 49%）. Percentage of GD group with rich blood flow detected by CDFI（94%） was higher than that of HT patients with hyperthyroidism group（35%）（P＜0.05）. Conclusions: GD pediatric patients have similar clinical features and size of thyroid with those of HT with hyperthyroidism, which make it difficult to differentiate. Patients with higher TRAb level and abundant blood flow by CDFI imply a high possibility of GD, while those with increased levels of anti-TPOAb, anti-TGAb and non-abundant blood flow by CDFI are likely to have HT with hyperthyroidism. CDFI may provide reference for distinguishing GD from HT with hyperthyroidism."

In addition,the pregnancy outcomes and neonate status of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis,pregnancy hypothyroidism（TPO-Ab and TG-Ab negative）and normal pregnant women were retrospectively compared. Results:（1）There were 1 216 women in the first trimester,646 in the second trimester and 1287 in the third trimester. The reference value range of serum TSH in three trimesters were 0.04-3.73 μIU/mL,0.10-4.03 μIU/mL and 0.68-4.32 μIU/mL,respectively;FT4 were 13.2-23.0 pmol/L,9.8-17.4 pmol/L and 10.7-20.1 pmol/L;FT3 were 3.8-6.2 pmol/L,3.3-5.7 pmol/L and 3.1-5.0 pmol/L.（2）There were 182 women in the Hashimoto’s group,180 in the hypothyroidism group and 180 in the normal control group.

The TCM constitution distribution and its relationship with thyroid nodules were investigated. Results: The highest proportion of single constitution was qi deficiency constitution（83.69%）,blood stasis constitution（78.54%）,qi constraint constitution（58.80%）,damp-heat constitution（42.92%）,phlegm-damp（30.90%） and yin deficiency constitution（30.90%）. Patients with qi deficiency constitution, blood stasis constitution, qi constraint constitution and inherited special constitution were significantly older than those without corresponding constitution（P＜0.05）,and patients with yin deficiency constitution were younger than those without yin deficiency constitution（P＜0.05）. In patients with two constitutions, there were more with qi deficiency and blood stasis constitution（71.67%）, qi deficiency and phlegm-damp constitution（63.95%）, phlegm-damp and blood stasis constitution（58.80%）,qi deficiency and qi constraint constitution（52.79%）,qi constraint and blood stasis constitution（47.64%） and qi constraint and phlegm-damp constitution（47.21%）,who were significantly older than those without corresponding constitution（P＜0.05）,and patients with qi deficiency and phlegmdamp constitution were significantly younger than those without that constitution（P＜0.05）. In patients with three constitutions,there were more with constitution of qi deficiency,phlegm-damp and blood stasis（44.64%）, constitution of qi deficiency, qi constraint and blood stasis（39.06%）, constitution of qi constraint,phlegm-damp and blood stasis（38.63%）,and constitution of qi deficiency,qi constraint and phlegm-damp（38.20%）. In patients with four constitutions, there were more with constitution of qi deficiency,blood stasis,phlegm-damp and qi constraint（34.76%）,and they were significantly older than those without that constitution（P＜0.05）. The majority of constitution type was four constitutions（51.93%）.Patients with three,four and five constitutions were significantly older than those with single constitution and two constitutions（P＜0.05）,and they had a higher proportion of multiple thyroid nodules than that in patients with single constitution（P＜0.05）. Patients with four and five constitutions were significantly older than those with three constitutions,and they had a higher proportion of multiple thyroid nodules than that in patients with two constitutions and three constitutions（P＜0.05）. Conclusion: CLT patients are mainly characterized by biased constitution and mixed constitution. The older the age, the more complex the constitution, the more mixed constitution, and the higher the proportion of multiple thyroid nodules. It suggests that the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease should be taken into account the multiple constitution factors,and should avoid over-simple syndrome differentiation,so as to improve the clinical effect."

Western medicine thinks it has a relationship with the autoimmunication. As a result, it also named autoimmune Thyroditis. However, the western medicine has no effect therapy to the irregulation of the disease. Professor Zhang has got particular and affluent experience to this kind of disease after dealing with medicine many years. She has concluded a distinctive theory of how to treat CLT with Traditional Chinese Medicine, which bases on the three zang-organs----the liver, the spleen and the kidney, and divided into three stages, and get satisfactory clinical effect."

The Research of the Usage of High Frequency Ultrasonography in Diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis,https://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CMFD&filename=1011099508.nh,梁雪,Chinese Master's Theses Full-text Database,2011-04-01,Master's Theses,,high frequency ultrasound image;; chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis;; sonography image type;,"Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis,（CTL）,also known as Hashimoto’s disease（HT）,is a kind of interstitial lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid pathological features of chronic inflammatory autoimmune thyroid disease.It is the most common thyroid disease. The incidence of HT increased gradually in recent years.It had reported that thyroid cancer sometimes resulted from HT malignant transformation,some scholars believe that HT belongs to precancerous lesion.However,the clinical HT is often coexist with other thyroid diseases, such as thyroid adenoma, thyroid cancer, nodular goiter。Its clinical manifestations are diverse and complex that leads to misdiagnosis, wrong treatment and underwent surgical treatment. How to improve the diagnostic rate of HT and reduce the misdiagnosis rate is the goal of many researchers. This study uses high frequency ultrasonography for ultrasound images of HT to create a new objective diagnostic criteria,in order to improve the diagnosis rate, reducing misdiagnosis HT.     Objective: To use high frequency ultrasonography for ultrasound images of HT to create a new objective diagnostic criteria, in order to improve the diagnosis rate, reducing misdiagnosis HT.     Methods: From December 2008 to January 2010,150 cases of HT were diagnosed by high frequency ultrasound, and confirmed by surgery or biopsy.150 cases were conducted thyroid endocrine function test.The normal control group of 50 female cases was used as a comparative study. Using the American GE Logiq7 type ultrasound diagnostic instrument,Conventional examinate bilateral thyroid lobes and isthmus and observe thyroid size, shape and internal echoes.Adopt a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics of each group, including general information, assistant examination and so on.     Results: 1、High-frequency ultrasound and pathological control study found that although HT ultrasonographic varied, but not disorderly to follow. Therefore,150 patients with HT were divided into six types according to the High-frequency ultrasound and pathology:type①,Glands rough pattern;type②,Diffuse scattered micronodulars pattern;type③Diffuse medium nodulars pattern;type④,Large flake echo reduce pattern;type⑤. Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern.type⑥Diffuse hypoechoic pattern.2、In this study,the disease is 7.82 times as frequent in women as in men,more common in young and middle-aged.HT male patients are more common in Diffuse scattered micronodulars pattern and Large flake echo reduce pattern.Female patients were found in all types.Diffuse scattered micronodulars pattern in the male to female ratio was 1:4.25, Large flake echo reduce pattern in the male to female ratio was 1:6.60.TheX2 test showed the two groups P = 0.4434 （p＞ 0.05）, the sex ratio was no significant difference.HT 6 group among the groups ＜30 years old 30 to-50 age group and＞ 50 years the number of cases with significant differences（P＜0.05）,Glands rough pattern、Diffuse scattered micronodulars pattern、Diffuse medium nodulars pattern、Large flake echo reduce pattern、Diffuse hypoechoic pattern are the most common in age group 30-50, and Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern are the most common in age over 50 years of age group. Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern of the average age is too large, but aftert examination showed Glands rough pattern and Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern （P = 0.024）, Diffuse scattered micronodulars pattern with Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern （P = 0.014） in the age distribution of significant differences between other groups in the age distribution was no significant difference.3. Glands rough pattern,Diffuse scattered micronodulars pattern between the normal control group in the thickening of the thyroid glands was no significant difference . Diffuse medium nodulars pattern,Large flake echo reduce pattern;Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern、Diffuse hypoechoic pattern.were thickening of the thyroid gland, thickening rate:Scattered large nodules with glandular echo reduce pattern＞Large flake echo reduce pattern＞Diffuse hypoechoic pattern＞Diffuse medium nodulars pattern,54 cases of which isthmus thickened.4, Diffuse medium nodules and other groups in the situation in the TGA and TMA were detected a significant difference, P ＜0.05. Diffuse nodulars to TGA, TMA mostly positive; Large flake echo reduce pattern and Diffuse hypoechoic pattern were significant differences（P = 0.041）.Large flake echo reduce pattern compared to Diffuse hypoechoic pattern witn TGA, TMA-negative rate was more High.

The clinical symptoms of HT are atypical,the common complains are neck mass and hyperthyroidism performance, which cause the result of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery treatment. Doctors became pay attention on TC in combination with HT because of the increased incidence in recent years. Currently, clinical diagnose relies on the preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy and the color Doppler ultrasound. However, the amount of cell sample which come from the aspiration biopsy is insufficient. But the pathologic diagnosis of the disease above is in highly demanding, at the same time the sensitivity and specificity is variable. On the other hand, the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer was low, because its variability in real background of ultrasound. The coincidence of the color Doppler and clinical diagnosis of HT was low. Thyroid biopsy （CNB）, is simple, safe, less complications and the advantages of high accuracy. The use of CNB can reduce the excessive surgery of Benign nodules and provide a ample basis for sufficient diagnosis. This article aims to explore the CNB in the diagnosis of the clinical significance of HT.     Objective     Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous minimally invasive biopsy in the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and the clinical significance      Methods     Review 92 patients from January 2009 to December 2009 who diagnosed thyroiditis and thyroiditis with thyroid nodules through biopsy in our hospital. The diagnosis, treatment and the follow-up results were analyzed.     Results     Derived satisfaction biopsy in 92 patients, puncture success rate was 100%. Biopsy diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in 32 cases, combined with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in 20 cases of nodular goiter, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis with thyroid cancer, 40 cases. 49 patients underwent surgical biopsy and pathology consistent with rate of 97.96%. 1 case of false negative and false-negative rate of 2.04%, no false positive. The patients, get the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis combined with nodular goiter, underwent the anti thyroid treatment. follow-up study showed that the thyroid ultrasonography and thyroid function tests of the above 92 patients got varying degrees of improvement targets. All the patients have not hot adverse reactions and complications during the puncture process.     Conclusion     Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy diagnosis of thyroiditis have confirmed meaning, which makes up the limitations which relying on imaging and the check of thyroid autoantibodies. The diagnostic accordance rate of thyroiditis combined with thyroid cancer was improved and the rate of the benign nodules excessive operation is reduced. To sum up, Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy is an accurate, safe and simple method of diagnosis of thyroiditis, which provides a sufficient basis for proper treatment."

In recent years, with the improvement of living standards andthe change of life style, the decreased amount of sports activities、the changeof dietary structure and genetic factors have become the main factors of risingrates of CLT, which influence the quality of life seriously.Immunosuppressivedrugs are used to solve the problem in Modern Medicine. Those HD patients whosedisease process develop to hypothyroidism need to take long-term replacementtherapy with thyroid hormone, those HD patients accompanied with hyperthyroidismare not advocated to take anti-thyroid drugs. If necessary, you should use itin small doses and short-range, review thyroid function closely. You can alsoadopt effective symptomatic treatment with Propranolol. Radioiodine therapyand surgical treatment are not used generally.But for those who has the diffusethyroid enlargement, we don’t even have specific treatment except surgicaloperation.All the methods we mentioned above can’t correct Immune disordersand each one has its own limitation.To discuss the treatment principles of thisdisease from the point of view of traditional Chinese medicine shows greatadvantages and potential.Zhang Lan professor has a unique and rich experienceof treatment with this disease.In Professor Zhang’s opinion, the significantclinical features of this disease should belong to “goiter” and “gall” inTraditional Chinese Medicine.The pathogenesis of this disease is associated withintegrated factors such as debility, emotional stress, attack of the sixexogenous pathogens, improper diet and so on, which leads to spleen astheniaand dampness phlegm accumulation because of debility or improper diet. Maybe debility or attack of the six exogenous pathogens damages vital qi further, thenleads to both spleen and kidney deficiency; Perhaps emotional stress、liverdepression and qi stagnation、blood stasis and qi stagnation leads to blood stasisresistance step by step. Finally qi stagnation, phlegm and blood stasis gathertogether in front of neck, then gall disease comes out.So the pathogenesis ofthis disease is complex, which belongs to primary deficiency and secondaryexcess.Professor Zhang’s treatment of this disease is according to thetreatment principles of diagnosis and treatment based on an overall analysisof the illness and the patient’s condition and give consideration to bothSuperficiality and origin.We adopt the methods of soothing the liver,invigorating the spleen, tonifying the kidney, promoting the circulation ofqi and reducing phlegm, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis,softening hard lumps and dispelling nodes in treatment of this disease. Throughclinical observation we got great curative effect. Now let me summarize ProfessorZhang’s treatment experiences as follows."

Early diagnosis and decline in rate of misdiagnosis are beneficial for therapeutic and cured. The slow pace of development results that it is hard to be found early in the disease. Achievements of modern clinical treatments, including the hormone replacement therapy, the immunomodulatory thetapy, and the surgical treatment, have been approved. Limitations and adverse effects cannot be neglected. Even though Chinese medicine treatment achieved a lot, uniform standards for diagnosis and efficacy assessment remain vacant.    Purpose    By using epidemiologic methods Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis syndromes of traditional Chinese Medicine information are collected. For the purpose of providing valuable reference for TCM differentiation and treatment, the study discusses distrution of the syndrome characteristics and elements. Meantime the relationship between the index changes and the Chinese syndrome elements will guide objective items to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Chinese Medicine. Methods    The study used cross-sectional method after investigation about the departed literature, to establish the Chinese Medicine information collection aims to the Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis clinical characteristics and associated symptoms. According to inclusion and exclusion criterion, select patients with Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital utpatient or hospitalization from August 2013to February2014. Construct information database by collecting material from the patients, and extract the syndrome elements and statistical analysis.    Results    1. Statistical analysis of datas on246cases show that the main clinical symptoms are mental fatigue, weakness, extrnme chilliness, vexation sleeplessness, palpitation, dryness of the mouth and throat, and local scleroma. The colors of tongue can be dark, red and reddish. The pulse condition of the disease can be thin, sink, slippery and stringlike.    2. Dimensionalitu reduction of the46characters with factor analysis concludes13common factors. Refer to the ""Clinical part of terminology of traditional Chinese Medicine"" and the ""Chinese Medicine clinical research guidelines"", symptoms are divided into seven character categories, including deficiency of Qi, deficiency of Ying, deficiency of Yang, deficiency of blood, stagnation of blood, phlegm-dampness, intrinsic heat. The main position catefories are heart, diver, spleen and lung.    3.By cluster analysis and clinical practice the13common factors are summarized in five types, phlegm dampness spleen, deficiency of Yin, defiency of Yin and blood, deficiency of Yang and Qi, blood stasis heat.    4. To research the character elements and objective indicators with ANOVA and Logistic regression analysis, we find that the age of patients inversely related to deficiency of blood and blood stasis but positive correlated with deficiency of Yin. Conelusion    Syndrome elements of Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis are deficiency of Qi, deficiency of Ying, deficiency of Yang, deficiency of blood, stagnation of blood, phlegm-dampness, intrinsic heat. The TCM differentiation types are phlegm dampness spleen, deficiency of Yin, defiency of Yin and blood, deficiency of Yang and Qi, blood stasis heat. The relationship between elements and clinical indicators has been confirmed. For the clinical diagnosis and treatment providing a basis, the Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis sydromes has been formed.

Therefore there is may significant improvement in thyroid autoimmune disorders inflammatory state,by adjusting the constitution to shorten the course of the disease or even basis theoretical for curing diseases.MethodsReferring to CLT diagnostic criteria in""Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases in China""by the endocrine branch of the Chinese Medical Association,102 patients with CLT was screened from 330 patients by meeting the inclusion criteria of this study and not having the standard of ruling out and eliminating of this study in the endocrine outpatient and inpatient wards of hospital.This study investigated include general epidemiological survey and body constitution investigations and related laboratory tests （thyroid function and it’s antibodies, liver function, blood routine tests）results（The data are from the clinical laboratory of Dongfang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine）.TCM constitution adopted criteria""Chinese constitution classification and decision tables"". Sample sizes according to the coefficient of variation and confidence interval estimated.With Epidate,Excel and other software to establish a database,this study summarized survey data of FT3,FT4 normal CLT patients.SPSS 21.0 software package was used for general statistical methods,including descriptive statistics,nonparametric test,chi-square test,data mining including cluster analysis,regression analysis.All statistical data were tested by two-sided test.When P value is less than 0.05 for the test index,the result has statistical significance.Measurement data are described in this way that mean add and subtract standard deviation.Research production（1）In this survey,the female with CLT were significantly more than the male,and the male to female ratio was 1:6.85.The age of onset was mainly in 20-39 years old and 50-59 years old.The course of disease was mainly located in 1-60 months.CLT patients with normal thyroid function as the main.（2）In this survey,there are 15 cases of simple constitution including 12 cases of ideal body constitution,l cases of Qi deficiency,1 cases of Qi stagnation,and 1 cases of Yin deficiency in all CLT patients.And 87 cases of mingled body constitution,often mixed 2-5 kind of body constitution.In the survey,the 9 kinds of constitution distribution frequency of 102 patients with FT3,FT4 normal CLT reach to 324 times,including 31 cases of ideal body constitution,63 cases of Qi asthenia constitution,52 cases of Qi stagnation constitution,48 cases of Yang deficiency constitution,39 cases of Phlegm-dampness constitution,35 cases of Yin deficiency constitution,29 cases of Dampness-heat constitution,22 cases of Blood stasis constitution,5 cases of Special intrinsic constitution.（3）In the investigation,constitution frequency distribution of 102 CLT patients analysized by hierarchical cluster,with binary Euclidean distance metric to cluster analysis.The result is that:Qi asthenia constitution,Qi stagnation constitution,often each other blended,Qi asthenia constitution,Yang deficiency constitution,often each other blended,Yin deficiency,Phlegm-dampness and dampness-heat constitution often mixed,Blood stasis and Yin deficiency often mixed,Ideal body constitution is often a simple constitution.（4）The nine kinds of body constitution were set to the dependent variable,and FT3, FT4,TSH,thyroid specific antibody,age stratified were set to covariate and in the way of backward stepwise method （likelihood ratio statistic） were factors binary Logistic regression analysis.When the dependent variable is Yang deficiency constitution,TPOAb stratification,TGAb stratificationage as a factor entered the regression equation.TPOAb stratification,TGAb stratificationage correlated with Yang deficiency constitution were positively.The higher TPOAb stratification,TGAb stratificationage,the greater the possibility of Yang deficiency constitution.The rest of the body into the regression equation of the factors did not find statistical significance.ResultThe main kind of body constitution of patients with FT3,FT4 normal CLT is mixed constitution,and its distribution frequencies were significantly higher than that of simple constitution. And the main kinds of blended constitution are Qi asthenia,Qi stagnation,Yang deficiency,moreover the three easily mixed with each other.In addition to the blended body constitution were Qi asthenia constitution and Qi stagnation constitution,Qi asthenia constitution and Yang deficiency constitution, Yin deficiency,Phlegm-dampness and Dampness-heat constitution,Blood stasis and Yin deficiency.This suggests that the common physical types of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is Qi asthenia,Qi stagnation and deficiency of Yang and may cause Qi stagnation resulted in Qi asthenia,Yang deficiency and the pathological product accumulation,syndrome of deficiency of fluid,Phlegm-dampness,Dampness-heat,Blood stasis and Yin deficiency,leading to the progression of the disease and deteriorationTPOAb,TGAb titer Stratification and Yang and quality-related,TPOAb,TGAb stratified higher,the greater the likelihood of Yang deficiency.Timely adjustment of Yang deficiency and other biased constitution for improving quality and TGAb TPOAb titer levels may help,but it need further research confirms."
